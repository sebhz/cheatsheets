# Timekeeping standards

## Definition of the second

Caesium atomic clocks serve as the primary standard for the definition of the second in the International System of Units (SI).
A second is defined as "*9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom*".

This definition was adopted in 1967.

## Universal Time (UT / UT1)

Universal time (UT or UT1) is a time standard based of Earth's rotation. It was originally the mean solar time at 0 degree longitude. It is now computed differently.
The computation involves measuring the Earth's angle with respect to the Internations Celestial Reference Frame (ICRP), a.k.a the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA).
UT1 is the same everywhere on Earth.

### History and relationship with GMT

In 1847, Britain established *Greenwich Mean Time* (GMT) to unify time within Britain. All clocks in Britain were set to this time, whatever to local solar noon.
GMT was calibrated to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich using telescopes. The clocks were sync'ed using chronometers or telegraphy.

At the end of the International Meridian Conference, on October 22nd 1884, the recommended base reference for world time was announced to be the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich *from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight".
In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon.

Between 1848 and 1972, all major countries adopted time zones based on the Greenwich meridian.

In 1928, the term Universal Time was introduced by the International astronomical Union to refer to the civil GMT (starting at mean midnight), in order to avoid confusion with the astronomical GMT (starting at mean noon).

Effective Jan 1st 1956, UT was divided into UT0 (UT as formerly computed), UT1 (UT0 corrected for polar motion) and UT2 (UT0 corrected for polar motion and seasonal variation).
UT1 was sufficient for most applications, while UT2 was to be broadcast over radio to the public.
UT0 and UT2 became irrelevant with the introduction of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Since the rotation of Earth is not uniform, a UT second (=1/86400th of an UT day) is slightly difference from an SI second. This discrepancy is taken into account by UTC.

## International Atomic Time (TAI)

International Atomic Time (TAI) is a time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on the Earth geoid.
TAI is a weighted average of the time kept by over 450 atomic clocks in over 80 national laboratories worldwide.
It is a continuous scale of time, without leap seconds, and it is the principal realisation of Terrestrial Time (with a fixed offset of epoch).
It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface and which has leap seconds.

## Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

Coordinated Universal Time or UTC is the primary time standard globally used to regulate clocks and time.
It establishes a reference for the current time, forming the basis for civil time and time zones. UTC facilitates international communication, navigation, scientific research, and commerce.

UTC has been widely embraced by most countries and is the effective successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in everyday usage and common applications.

UTC is not a timezone (but UTC+00 is a timezone). However, it is a point in space time: it is anchored to Terrestrial Time, which is anchored to the Greenwich meridian through its TAI realization.

### Leap seconds

UTC started being used in 1961. The redefinition of the second in 1967 caused UTC seconds (sync'ed on UT) and TAI seconds to be different. In 1972, the addition of leap seconds to UTC was implemented.
UTC seconds and TAI seconds now have the same size. A leap second is added or substracted as required to UTC, so that UTC never drifts further than 0.9 seconds from UT1.

Both scales were sync'ed on January 1st 1972. 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10 TAI. At this time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to match the tick rate of TAI.

## Terrestrial Time (TT)

Terrestrial Time (TT) is a modern astronomical time standard defined by the International Astronomical Union, primarily for time-measurements of astronomical observations made from the surface of Earth.
 For example, the Astronomical Almanac uses TT for its tables of positions (ephemerides) of the Sun, Moon and planets as seen from Earth. In this role, TT continues Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or TD), which succeeded ephemeris time (ET). TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the irregularities in the rotation of Earth.

The unit of TT is the SI second, the definition of which is based currently on the caesium atomic clock, but TT is not itself defined by atomic clocks. It is a theoretical ideal, and real clocks can only approximate it.

TT is distinct from the time scale often used as a basis for civil purposes, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). TT is indirectly the basis of UTC, via International Atomic Time (TAI). Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, TT is 32.184 s ahead of TAI.
